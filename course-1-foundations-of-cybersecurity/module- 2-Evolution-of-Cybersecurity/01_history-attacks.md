# 🕰️ History of Early Attacks

In Module 2 we trace the origins of modern cybersecurity by examining two seminal incidents:

---

## 🐛 Morris Worm (1988)
- **Overview:** One of the first self-replicating worms on the ARPANET.
- **Impact:** Infected ~10% of connected machines, demonstrating how a single exploit could paralyze a network.
- **IAM Takeaway:**  
  - ▶️ **CSIRT Formation** (CISSP Domain 7): Prompted creation of Computer Security Incident Response Teams.  
  - ▶️ **Risk Management** (CISSP Domain 1): Highlighted need for formal risk assessment frameworks.

## 💌 LOVELETTER (ILOVEYOU) Virus (2000)
- **Overview:** Spread via email attachments titled “LOVE-LETTER-FOR-YOU.txt.vbs.”
- **Impact:** Caused over US\$10 billion in global damages by overwriting files and sending itself to all contacts.
- **IAM Takeaway:**  
  - ▶️ **Email Gateway Scanning** (CISSP Domain 7): Led to mandatory malware scanning for inbound mail.  
  - ▶️ **Identity Verification** (CISSP Domain 5 & 4): Drove adoption of sender authentication (SPF, DKIM).

> 🔍 **Reflection:**  
> These early attacks proved that **people** and **process** matter as much as technology. Today, IAM policies and incident response teams remain our first line of defense.
