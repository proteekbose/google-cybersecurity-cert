# 👥 Threat Actors & Their Motivations

Knowing who targets you guides proactive IAM design.

---

## 🎯 Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs)
- **Profile:** Well-resourced nation-state or crime syndicate.  
- **Tactics:** Long-term stealth, tailored exploits.  
- **IAM Strategy:**  
  - 🚨 **Continuous authentication** & session revalidation  
  - 📑 **Detailed audit trails** (Domain 6)

---

## 🏴‍☠️ Insider Threats
- **Profile:** Employees or contractors abusing legitimate access.  
- **Tactics:** Data exfiltration, sabotage.  
- **IAM Strategy:**  
  - 🔄 **Just-in-time privilege elevation**  
  - ⚠️ **Behavioral anomaly detection**

---

## ✊ Hacktivists & Ethical Hackers
- **Profile:** Politically or ethically motivated.  
- **Tactics:** DDoS, defacements, vulnerability research.  
- **IAM Strategy:**  
  - 📜 **Clear policy governance** (Domain 1)  
  - 🛠️ **Pen-test coordination** (Domain 6 & 8)

---

## 🎓 New & Unskilled Actors
- **Profile:** Script kiddies and novice hackers.  
- **Tactics:** Run known exploits and malware kits.  
- **IAM Strategy:**  
  - 🔄 **Automated patching & threat intel feeds**  
  - 🔐 **Least-privilege by default**

> 💡 **Final Thought:**  
> Every actor type—from APTs to amateurs—relies on identity failures. Robust IAM is your universal defense.
