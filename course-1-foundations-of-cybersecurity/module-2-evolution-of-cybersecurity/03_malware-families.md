# 🦠 Malware Families

Malware remains a top threat. Each family demands distinct IAM and endpoint measures.

---

## 🔬 Viruses
- **Behavior:** Attach to host files; require user execution.  
- **Danger:** Corrupt data, spread via email or removable media.  
- **IAM & Endpoint Ties:**  
  - 📂 **File integrity monitoring**  
  - 🔒 **Role-based user permissions**

---

## 🐛 Worms
- **Behavior:** Self-replicates over networks without user action.  
- **Danger:** Exponential spread, high network load.  
- **IAM & Network Ties:**  
  - 🌐 **Network segmentation** (Domain 4)  
  - ✅ **Automated account lockouts** on abnormal activity

---

## 💰 Ransomware
- **Behavior:** Encrypts files, demands payment for decryption key.  
- **Danger:** Operational paralysis, data loss.  
- **IAM Ties:**  
  - 🔑 **Just-in-time privileged access** (least-privilege)  
  - 📜 **Immutable backups** with user-specific retention

---

## 🕵️‍♂️ Spyware
- **Behavior:** Covertly collects user data (keystrokes, screenshots).  
- **Danger:** Privacy breach, intellectual property theft.  
- **IAM & Monitoring Ties:**  
  - 🔍 **Continuous audit logging** (Domain 6)  
  - 🚩 **User behavior analytics** (anomaly detection)

> 💭 **Pro Tip:**  
> Combine strong IAM policies with EDR/AV tools to detect and contain infected endpoints quickly.
