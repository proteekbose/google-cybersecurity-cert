# PII vs SPII

Organizations categorize personal data to apply proper safeguards.

---

## Personally Identifiable Information (PII)  
- **Definition:** Data that can identify an individual.  
- **Examples:** Name, email, phone number.  
- **IAM Controls:**  
  - Least-privilege access policies  
  - Encryption at rest/in transit  

## Sensitive PII (SPII)  
- **Definition:** Subset of PII that requires stricter handling.  
- **Examples:** Biometric data, financial/account numbers, medical records.  
- **IAM Controls:**  
  - Step-up authentication (MFA)  
  - Just-in-time privileged access  
  - Stronger encryption and monitoring

> **Use Case:**  
> A help-desk agent can view a user’s email (PII) but cannot access their financial records (SPII) without additional MFA and approval.
