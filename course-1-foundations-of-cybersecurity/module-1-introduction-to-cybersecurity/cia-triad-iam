# CIA Triad & IAM

The **CIA Triad**—Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability—is the foundational model of cybersecurity.  
As an IAM engineer, I map each pillar to identity controls:

---

## Confidentiality  
- **Definition:** Prevent unauthorized disclosure of data.  
- **IAM Example:** Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) ensures only permitted users see sensitive resources.

## Integrity  
- **Definition:** Guarantee data is unaltered and trustworthy.  
- **IAM Example:** Audit logs in IAM track who changed permissions and when, detecting tampering.

## Availability  
- **Definition:** Ensure timely and reliable access to resources.  
- **IAM Example:** High-availability IdP clusters and failover authentication maintain uninterrupted login.

> **Reflection:**  
> IAM not only gates access but becomes the measurement stick for each CIA pillar. Next, I’ll explore terminology that underpins these concepts.
