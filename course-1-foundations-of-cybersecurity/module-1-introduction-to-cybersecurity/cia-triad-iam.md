# 🔒 CIA Triad & IAM

The **CIA Triad**—**Confidentiality**, **Integrity**, and **Availability**—forms the cornerstone of modern cybersecurity. As an **IAM Engineer**, I translate each pillar into actionable identity controls:

---

## 🛡️ Confidentiality  
> *Prevent unauthorized disclosure of data.*  
- **IAM Control:** Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)  
- **Real-World Example:** Only designated user roles (e.g., “HR Manager”) can access sensitive personnel files.

---

## 🔍 Integrity  
> *Ensure data remains accurate and unaltered.*  
- **IAM Control:** Audit Logging & Change Tracking  
- **Real-World Example:** Every permission change is recorded with timestamp and user ID, enabling rapid tamper detection.

---

## ⚡ Availability  
> *Maintain reliable, uninterrupted access to resources.*  
- **IAM Control:** High-Availability Identity Providers (IdPs)  
- **Real-World Example:** Clustered authentication servers with automated failover guarantee login service even during outages.

> 💭 **Reflection:**  
> IAM doesn’t just gate access—it defines **how** we measure and enforce each pillar of the CIA Triad.  
>  
> Next up: Exploring the **terminology** that underpins these concepts.
