# Cybersecurity Terminology

A shared vocabulary accelerates clear communication. Below are key terms from Module 1:

| Term                | Definition                                                       | IAM Perspective                                      |
|---------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| **Threat Actor**    | An entity (person/group) that exploits vulnerabilities.          | Block via adaptive MFA when anomalous logins occur.  |
| **Vulnerability**   | A flaw in system or process that can be exploited.               | Ensure IAM patches and config hardening close gaps.  |
| **Risk**            | Likelihood × impact of a threat exploiting a vulnerability.      | Risk-based access policies (step-up authentication). |
| **Compliance**      | Adherence to regulations & policies.                             | IAM audit trails provide evidence for audits.        |
| **Security Posture**| Overall security strength and readiness.                         | IAM maturity (e.g., RBAC, MFA coverage) measures it. |
